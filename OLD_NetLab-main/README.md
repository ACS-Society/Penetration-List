## INTRODUCTION
![My project(2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64241933/177379574-971cb13f-83b1-4c16-a803-d359c898ec30.png)



Netlab is a professional, open-source networking lab available on GitHub that provides a comprehensive platform for networking enthusiasts to enhance their network configuration skills and troubleshooting abilities. Our laboratory is exclusively dedicated to networking, offering hands-on experience with various devices that will allow you to modify and reconfigure device configurations at various levels. In our laboratory environment, you will have the opportunity to learn networking from the basics to more advanced topics such as IoT, routers, multi-layer switches, and firewalls. The labs are designed to provide a step-by-step approach to networking concepts and configurations, allowing you to build your expertise gradually.

As a part of the laboratory experience, you will be tasked with identifying misconfigurations and given hints to guide you through the process. This will enable you to learn how to solve networking problems and become proficient in troubleshooting and configuration. It is important to note that configuration files should only be checked and exported when absolutely necessary.

At Netlab, we pride ourselves on providing a user-friendly and professional platform for individuals who wish to enhance their networking skills. Our laboratory is an excellent resource for anyone who is passionate about networking and wants to learn from the basics to advanced levels.


   **Please don't check and export the config files unless needed.**
